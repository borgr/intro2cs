Standalone testing instructions:

1. Place your python files in this directory.

2. Run 'python3 tests_rt.py'

3. Run 'python3 tests_b.py'

4. Run 'python3 filelist.py <tarfile>', where '<tarfile>'
   is the name of your file, to determine if you are missing
   files, or have extra files.

If you are using Windows, bypass the mp_test method in autotest.py
by adding the line 'return None,target(*args,**kwargs)' to the
beginning of the method.

As the semester proceeds, you will learn how to modify these
files in order to run only some of the tests, or modify
them in ways that will help in debugging.
