Standalone testing instructions:

1. Place your python files in this directory.

2. Run 'python3 tests_t.py'

3. Run 'python3 tests_g.py'

4. Run 'python3 tests_m.py'

Some of the tests use a c extension which is provided.
If that cannot be loaded, (windows,) you can replace
the imports to import your own functions, which may not 
be correct.

5. Run 'python3 filelist.py <tarfile>', where '<tarfile>'
   is the name of your file, to determine if you are missing
   files, or have extra files.

If you are using Windows, bypass the mp_test2 method in autotest.py
by adding the line 'return target(*args,**kwargs)' to the
beginning of the method.

As the semester proceeds, you will learn how to modify these
files in order to run only some of the tests, or modify
them in ways that will help in debugging.
